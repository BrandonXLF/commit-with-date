**Commit with Date** is an Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to create or amend a Git commit with manually set author and committer dates.

## Features

### Author and committer dates support

Provides the ability to set the author date, the committer date, or both. Also allows you to synchronize the two with a single click.

### Default values

Much effort has been made to use the same default dates as git uses for standard commits, amending, rebasing, and merging.

### Preset dates

Provides convenient buttons to use and modify dates from relevant commits. Always provides a button to select the author/commit dates from the `HEAD`.

### Merge and rebase support

Support for continuing during rebases and committing during merges. When rebasing, provides a button to use the dates of the former commit (`REBASE_HEAD`). When merging, provides to use the dates from their commit (`MERGE_HEAD`).
